# AndroidVRgame-Claustrophobia

A VR game for android I made with my friends in 3rd semester as my Experiential Learning Centre (ELC) activity on Gaming and Animation. The objective: a virtual reality game/utility based solution for curing any of the phobias of real life.   

The game was made using 
- Unity
- JDK
- JRE
- GVR SDK  

for use with Google Cardboard. The game is based on Claustrophobia.
