# AndroidVRgame-Claustrophobia

A VR game for android I and my friends made for 3rd sem ELC activity on Gaming and Animation. The objective: a virtual reality game/utility based solution for helping the user overcome Claustrophobia.   

The game was made using 
- Unity
- JDK
- JRE
- GVR SDK  

for use with Google Cardboard. The game is to expose the user to confined spaces.

If you think the walls are closing in on you, that's just in your head and totally not an intentional game design ;)
