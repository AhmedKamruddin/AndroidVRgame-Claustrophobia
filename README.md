# AndroidVRgame-Claustrophobia

A VR game for android I made in 3rd semester as my Experiential Learning Centre (ELC) activity on Gaming and Animation. The topic: a virtual reality game/utility based solution for curing the any of the phobias of real life. The game was made using Unity, JDK, JRE, & GVR SDK for use with Google Cardboard.
